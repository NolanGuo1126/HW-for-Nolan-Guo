    "Summary\n",
    "In this analysis, we explored whether STA130 students could accurately identify the order of pouring milk and tea, inspired by the famous Fisher and Bristol tea experiment. A sample of 80 students was tested, with 49 correctly identifying the order, leading to the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀): The proportion of students who can correctly identify the order is 0.5, implying their guesses are as good as random.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): The proportion is not equal to 0.5, suggesting that students can identify the order better than random chance.\n",
    "We calculated the observed proportion of correct answers as ( \\hat{p} = 0.6125 ) and employed a hypothesis testing approach by simulating the sampling distribution under the null hypothesis. This involved running 10,000 simulations where we sampled proportions under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis resulted in a p-value, which indicates the probability of observing a proportion as extreme or more extreme than 0.6125, given that the null hypothesis holds. If the p-value is low (usually below 0.05), we would reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that the students' ability to identify the pouring order is statistically significant and not due to random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is higher, we would fail to reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the results could be attributed to chance. Overall, this experiment serves to illustrate the principles of hypothesis testing, sampling distributions, and statistical significance in a practical context.\n",

    "Evidence Against H₀: The smaller the p-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis. It suggests that the observed effect or difference is not just a product of random chance, leading us to conclude that something else (like a real effect or difference) is at play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling Distribution Context: When we visualize the sampling distribution under H₀, a small p-value often corresponds to our test statistic lying in the tails of this distribution — areas that are rare if the null hypothesis is accurate. Thus, such a result indicates it would be quite unusual to observe such extreme values if the null hypothesis were indeed true.\n",

    "In summary, a smaller p-value forces us to reconsider the validity of the null hypothesis because it suggests that the observed evidence is significantly out of line with what we would expect under that assumption.

    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "A most beloved piece of [statistical lore](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2012.00620.x) about the (most famous) statistician Ronald Fisher involves cups of tea with milk. Fisher and his friend and colleague, Dr. Muriel Bristol, worked at Cambridge in the 1920s and regularly had tea together. During one of their afternoon tea times, Bristol refused a cup of tea from Fisher because he put milk in first BEFORE pouring in the tea. Bristol said she could taste the difference, and much preferred the taste of tea when the milk was poured in afterward the tea. Fisher didn't think that there could be a difference and proposed a hypothesis test to examine the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher made 8 cups of tea, 4 with milk added in first and 4 with tea added in first, and gave them to Dr. Bristol without her seeing how they were made and she would say if she thought the tea or the milk was poured first. As it turned out, Bristol correctly identified if the tea or milk was poured first for all 8 of the cups. Fisher, being a skeptical statistician wanted to test if this could be happening by chance with Bristol just randomly guessing (or whether there was evidence against an assumption of Bristol just randomly guessing), and subsequently designed a statistical hypothesis test to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you run an experiment like this with students in STA130. You get a random sample of 80 STA130 students to each taste one cup of tea and tell you whether they think the milk or tea was poured first. **Suppose 49 students are able to correctly state which was poured first.** Provide a statistical analysis of this experiment as guided through the following set of questions.\n",

    "Relationship Between This Experiment and the Original with Fisher and Bristol\n",
    "The original experiment conducted by Fisher involved a small group of cups of tea prepared in two different ways (milk first or tea first) and tested by Bristol. In our experiment, we are taking a more systematic approach with a larger sample size of STA130 students to see if their ability to identify the order is beyond what would be expected by chance alone. Thus, the nature of our population—students—differs notably from Bristol's personalized taste test. Though the underlying question remains similar, we are using hypothesis testing to explore the concept statistically across a defined group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Statements of the Null Hypothesis and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H₀):\n",
    "Let ( p ) represent the true proportion of students who can correctly identify the order of milk and tea.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Version: ( H_0: p = 0.5 )\n",
    "Informal Interpretation: We are assuming that the students’ ability to correctly identify whether milk or tea was poured first is no better than random guessing, meaning they’d get it right half the time.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ):  \n",
    "\n",
    "Formal Version: ( H_a: p \\neq 0.5 )\n",
    "Interpretation: We believe that students can identify which was poured first better than chance, indicating that their identification skills are influenced by the order of pouring.\n",
    "Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "Observed Test Statistic: We observed that 49 out of 80 students were correct. Thus, the observed proportion of correct answers is:\n",
    "[\n",
    "\\hat{p} = \\frac{49}{80} = 0.6125\n",
    "]\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology Explanation: We can use hypothesis testing to analyze whether the observed proportion (0.6125) provides sufficient evidence against the null hypothesis. Specifically, we will estimate the p-value by simulating the distribution of the sample proportion under the null hypothesis (( H_0: p = 0.5 )).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulation of Sampling Distribution: We will simulate many samples of the same size (n = 80) under the null hypothesis and calculate the proportion of successes we would expect under random guessing (p = 0.5).\n",

    "Findings and Discussion\n",
    "Based on the simulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value derived from the analysis is the proportion of the simulated results that were equal to or greater than our observed proportion of 49 correct answers. This p-value will help us evaluate how extreme our observed result is under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Interpretation: \n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value is significantly low (commonly below 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis ( H_0 ), suggesting students’ identifications are better than chance.\n",
    "If the p-value is higher, it indicates that the correct identifications can be attributed to random guessing, leading us to fail to reject ( H_0 ).\n",
    "Conclusion Regarding the Null Hypothesis\n",
    "Our simulated p-value is low (below 0.05), we have sufficient evidence to conclude that students can distinguish between the two pouring"

    "Fisher’s Tea Experiment Analysis Report\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis is inspired by the famous Fisher’s Tea Experiment, where Dr. Muriel Bristol claimed she could distinguish whether milk or tea was poured first into a cup. The original hypothesis test conducted by Ronald Fisher aimed to determine whether Dr. Bristol’s correct identifications were due to random chance or an actual ability to tell the difference. In this current experiment, we extend Fisher’s idea to a sample of 80 students from STA130, where 49 correctly identified which was poured first. Our goal is to determine whether this result is statistically significant, meaning if it’s better than random guessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship Between This Experiment and the Original\n",
    "\n",
    "In Fisher’s experiment, Dr. Bristol tasted 8 cups of tea, with 4 made with milk poured first and 4 with tea poured first. The experiment’s nature was highly personalized, focusing on her specific ability. In contrast, the STA130 experiment involves a larger sample size (80 students) and a more abstract parameter: the general ability of students to identify the pouring order. However, both experiments test whether the observed correct identifications are due to random guessing or a real discernment ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Null and Alternative Hypotheses\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tNull Hypothesis (H_0): The students are guessing randomly. This means the probability of correctly identifying the pouring order is 50%, i.e., p = 0.5.\n",
    "\t•\tAlternative Hypothesis (H_A): The students have an ability to correctly identify the pouring order better than random guessing, i.e., p > 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "In informal terms, the null hypothesis suggests that students do not have any special ability to determine whether milk or tea was poured first, and their correct guesses are due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "We will conduct a hypothesis test for a proportion to determine whether the 49 out of 80 students correctly identifying the pouring order is statistically significant. Specifically, we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t1.\tSimulate a sampling distribution under H_0 (random guessing with p = 0.5).\n",
    "\t2.\tEstimate the p-value to assess the likelihood of observing 49 or more correct identifications under the assumption of H_0.\n",
    "\t3.\tAlternatively, we can compute a confidence interval for the proportion and check if p = 0.5 lies within the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Python and the np.random.seed() function to make the analysis reproducible."

    "    \n",
    "Using p-values and hypothesis testing appropriately is an important ethical and professional responsibility of anyone doing data analysis. Actually, there is quite the quiet Contra-Versy (or is it Con-TROV-ersy?) around p-values. First, on a general level, it seems quite clear that p-values and hypothesis testing methodologies MUST play some ongoing contributing role in the so-called \"replication crisis\" rampantly afflicting mordern science; namely, \"significant findings\" made in scientific studies are not able to be reproduced by future studies at an alarming rate; and, this whole paradigm of \"significant findings\" is based on p-values and hypothesis testing... so, something's going on with this methodology in some way...\n",
    "    \n",
    "More specifically however, p-values are themselves quite problematic. To see this, just briefly consider the following article titles...\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Why are p-values controversial?](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2016.1277161) \n",
    "- [What a nerdy debate about p-values shows about science and how to fix it](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/7/31/16021654/p-values-statistical-significance-redefine-0005)\n",
    "- [The reign of the p-value is over: what alternative analyses could we employ to fill the power vacuum?](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2019.0174)\n",
    "- [Scientists rise up against statistical significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9)\n",
    "- [Statistics experts urge scientists to rethink the p-value](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/statistics-experts-urge-scientists-rethink-p-value)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the issues here are relatively advanced and subtle (as introduced [here](https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~berger/p-values.html), presented [here](https://www.jarad.me/courses/stat587Eng/slides/Inference/I06-Pvalues/why_pvalues_dont_mean_what_you_think_they_mean.pdf), and demonstrated using simulation [here](https://jaradniemi.shinyapps.io/pvalue/)), the problem essentially comes down to the fact that most scientists (or just people) don't know how to really interpret the numeric value of a p-value. There are therefore two current proposed solutions to address this challenge.\n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Just interpreting p-values using the follwing table (which really isn't that hard, so it's surprising that this solution isn't more broadly adopted...)\n",

    "|p-value|Evidence|\n",

    "|$$0.01 \\ge p > 0.001$$|Strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "|$$0.001 \\ge p$$|Very strong evidence against the null hypothesis|\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only do **hypothesis testing** on the basis of confidence intervals, not **p-values** (which might be the best solution wherever doing so is a realistic, convenient  possibility...)\n",
    "\n",
    "With this quite broad introductory context in mind, what does your favorite ChatBot thinks about the following statements? \n",
    "    \n",
    "1. Hypothesis testing is not a \"mathematical proof\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. We do not prove $H_0$ false, we instead give evidence against the $H_0$: \"We reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ, meaning we have ABC evidence against the null hypothesis\"\n",
    "    2. We do not prove $H_0$ is true, we instead do not have evidence to reject $H_0$: \"We fail to reject the null hypothesis with a p-value of XYZ\"<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implying that a \"non-significant result\" means there is \"no effect\" misleads an audience because this may in actual fact simply indicate that there was insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis. So this therefore overlooks the possibility of sample size limitations, or Type II errors (which means a test incorrectly concludes that there is no effect or difference when, in fact, there is one). \n",
    "    \n",
    "> Similarly, analagously, a \"significant result\" used to reject the null hypothsis could alternatively be a Type I error (which means a test actually incorrectly rejected a null hypothesis when it was actually true)... we're only providing a measure of evidence against the null hypothesis... but the evidence could still incorrectly suggest the wrong conclusion... it really depends on how strong the evidence is...\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - all of which is why just interpreting p-values using the table above is a good idea...\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The p-values used for hypothesis testing are contructed upone the assumptions of the null hypotheses they correspond to; but, null hypotheses are actually often presented in simple forms that routinely hide a lot of information that is implicitly used to construct the p-values. For example, distributional assumptions about the population, estimated \"plug-in\" values that can used to simplify the problem calculations, and the reliance upon \"random sampling\", etc...<br><br>\n",
    "           \n",
    "4. Drawing overly broad conclusions, or making recommendations based on findings that reject the null hypothesis in a specific context is fraught with the problematic risks of overgeneralization errors. Further exacerbating this issue, null hypotheses are typically so called \"point null hypotheses\" which is meant to emphasize that they are mathematically increadibly sharply specific; whereas, alternative hypotheses are usually very unspecific. An alternative hypothesis that \"the null hypothesis is false\" doesn't say much... we should wonder, \"how, specfically, is the null false?\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "As an example really giving a demonstrating this, consider rejecting a null hypothesis that there is no correlation between rain and pizza's delivered. Such a decision doesn't specify what the actual hypothetical correlation might be. In fact, it doesn't even indicate if there are more or less pizzas delivered when it rains... \n",

    "> - trying to more clearly address what the plausible values of the parameter in question might be on the basis of hypothesis testing would require conducting further experiements to continously reject increasingly detailed hypothesies to narrow down what the alternative hypothesis might actually include... which would indeed be an utterly vapid misuse of the intended purpose of hypothesis testing entrprise... \n",
